# In Go, arrays and slices are both sequence types, but they have some key differences:

## Size: 
> 1. An array has a fixed size. This means once an array is declared, you cannot add or remove elements from it. On the other hand, a slice is dynamic, meaning you can add and remove elements from it.

## Declaration: 
> 1. When declaring an array, you specify the length. For example, var a [5]int. But when declaring a slice, you don't. For example, var s []int.

## Underlying Data Structure: 
> 1. An array is a value type. When you assign or pass around an array value you make a copy of the entire array. For slices, they are reference types. When you assign or pass around a slice, you are just sharing the reference to the underlying array.

## Flexibility: 
> 1. Slices are more flexible and are used more commonly in Go code than arrays. Slices can be resized using the built-in append function.

## Memory Efficiency: 
> 1. Since slices are dynamically sized, they can be more memory efficient than arrays as they can grow and shrink as needed.

Here's an example of how you might declare and use a slice:

```go
s := make([]int, 3) // Declare a slice of integers with a length (and capacity) of 3
s = append(s, 4)    // Append a value to the slice, increasing its length
```

In your code, a and b are arrays, while tdarr is a two-dimensional array. If you wanted to use slices instead, you could declare them like this:

```go
var arr1 [5]int

var tdarr [3][3]int
```

```go
s := make([]int, 5) // Declare a slice of integers with a length (and capacity) of 5
ts := make([][]int, 3) // Declare a two-dimensional slice of integers
```
