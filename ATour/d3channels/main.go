Notes:

- Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. You can send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine.
- Create a new channel with make(chan val-type). Channels are typed by the values they convey.
- By default channels are unbuffered, meaning that
- they will only accept sends (chan <-) if there is a corresponding receive (<- chan) ready to receive the sent value
